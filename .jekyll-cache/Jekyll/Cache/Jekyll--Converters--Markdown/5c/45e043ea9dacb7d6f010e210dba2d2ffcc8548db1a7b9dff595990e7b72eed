My name is Avetik Karagulyan. I am a third year Ph.D. student at <a href="http://crest.science/" style="color: #517394"> 
Center of Research in Economics and STatistics (CREST), Paris</a> 
under the supervision of professor <a href="http://www.arnak-dalalyan.fr/" style="color: #517394"> Arnak Dalalyan </a>.
The topic of my research is the problem of sampling with Langevin algorithm. In particular, I am interested in non-asymptotic results 
of convergence of both continuous and discretized Langevin dynamics. In 2018, I received my <a href="http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/"></a> MSc Mathematics, Vision, Learning (MVA) diploma 
at ENS Paris-Saclay with highest honors (mention "tr√®s bien").
